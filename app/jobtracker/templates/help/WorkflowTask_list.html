        <p>
            A workflow checklist item is a prompt on any job or phase that is required to be ticked when that job or phase is moving to the new state.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example; you could configure a checklist item on a Phase when moving to "Pending Technical QA" to prompt the user to ensure they have told the client testing has finished.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's worth noting, this functionality does not actually check or verify and is purely a mental reminder tool.
