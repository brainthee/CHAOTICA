        <strong>Guidance</strong>
        <p>
            A job is a grouping of contracted work. Generally, you would look to have each 'contract' or 'Scope of Work' defined as a job.            
        </p>
        <p>
            By contrast; a Job contains Phases. Each phase typically represents a task aligned with a service within a job.

            For example, an assessment of this site would be a job, and it's phases might include:
            <ul>
                <li>Phase 1 - Web Assessment of the system</li>
                <li>Phase 2 - External Infrastructure assessment of the target infrastructure</li>
                <li>Phase 3 - Build Review of the underlying host</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
