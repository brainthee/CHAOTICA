## What is CHAOTICA?

CHAOTICA was created out of the need to be able to track the lifecycle of security assessments across a team large enough that a Spreadsheet would send someone insane. 

It's been built with the core concept in mind that workflows and procedures should be baked in to the lifecycle of a job and help enforce good practices.

## What is CHAOTICA NOT?

It is not:

* A CRM or book keeping app
* A customer facing interface. It is for internal team use only.
* A replacement for corporate HR functions (the leave tracking is for convenience only)
